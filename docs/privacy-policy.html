    <h1>TimeLens Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 22, 2026</p>

    <p>TimeLens ("we", "our", or "the app") is a photo transformation application that uses artificial intelligence to reimagine your photos in different historical eras. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>TimeLens requires Google Sign-In to use the app. When you sign in, we receive the following information from your Google account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your profile picture URL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to identify your account and personalize your experience.</p>

    <h3>Photos</h3>
    <p>When you use TimeLens to transform a photo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You select or capture a photo using your device's camera or photo library</li>
        <li>The photo is sent to Google's Gemini API for AI-powered transformation</li>
        <li>The transformed photo is saved locally on your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your original and transformed photos are stored only on your device. We do not upload or store your photos on our servers.</p>

    <h3>Purchase Information</h3>
    <p>TimeLens offers in-app purchases for transformation credits. All purchases are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.). Your credit balance is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your account via Google Sign-In</li>
        <li>Process your photos through the AI transformation service</li>
        <li>Track your credit balance for in-app purchases</li>
        <li>Maintain your transformation history on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Google Gemini API</h3>
    <p>Photos you submit for transformation are processed by Google's Gemini API. According to Google's policies, images sent to the Gemini API for processing are not stored after the response is generated. For more information, see <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's Generative AI Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <h3>Google Sign-In</h3>
    <p>Authentication is handled by Google Sign-In. Your use of Google Sign-In is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Google Play Billing</h3>
    <p>In-app purchases are processed by Google Play. Your purchase transactions are subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Firebase</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Authentication to manage user sign-in. We do not use Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, or any other Firebase tracking services.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>The following data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transformed photos (in your app's private storage)</li>
        <li>Transformation history (era names, dates)</li>
        <li>Credit balance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
    <p>We store minimal data in the cloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your authentication session (managed by Firebase Authentication)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not backup your photos or transformation history to the cloud.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We only share data with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Your photos, temporarily, for AI processing only</li>
        <li><strong>Google/Firebase:</strong> Authentication data for sign-in purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

    <h3>Delete Your Photos</h3>
    <p>You can delete individual transformed photos from the History screen within the app, or delete all photos by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h3>Sign Out</h3>
    <p>You can sign out of your account at any time through the app's settings. Signing out will end your session but will not delete locally stored photos.</p>

    <h3>Delete Your Account</h3>
    <p>To completely remove your data, uninstall the app from your device. This will delete all locally stored photos, history, and credit information. To delete your Firebase Authentication record, you can revoke app access through your Google Account settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>TimeLens is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Google Sign-In, which is required to use the app, has its own age restrictions. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8. Analytics and Tracking</h2>

    <p>TimeLens does not use analytics services, advertising trackers, or crash reporting tools. We do not collect device identifiers, usage statistics, or behavioral data.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
